Hello
I made this application for creating massive pricelist updating to SAP.

In first page u telling program where to upload new prices
In second page u telling program what prices are for this indekses (without plant specification, only indeks supplier and price data needed)
In third page u telling program what records already exists in SAP system
in fourth page u telling program what sources already exists in SAP system (second step of adding price)


Then u click "WGRAJ" and ur records are sorted. All data is completed, after clicking a button u saving data to txt files prepared for SAP importing.
